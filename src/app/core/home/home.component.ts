    { review: 'Had chicken wings and beer. Went there just spend an hour or two. We sat in the rooftop area. Since turquoise is my favorite colour, I liked the place as their seats were of that colour. Ambience is good, with music playing in d background. Overall a good experience.', reviewBy: 'Akankshya', profile: 'https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/user_profile_pictures/b0b/a2f8577e47d6c18f74af55ad7b9a4b0b.jpg?fit=around%7C400%3A400&crop=400%3A400%3B%2A%2C%2A' },
